	* An inlet connection encapsulates the inlet's connection endpoint (for the other components of the inlet) 
	* and provides a recovery mechanism in case the connection breaks down (e.g., due to a remote computer crash).
	*
	* When a client of the connection (one of the other inlet components) experiences a connection loss it invokes the 
	* function try_recover_from_error() which attempts to update the endpoint to a valid state (possible once the stream is back online). 
	* Since in some cases a client might not be able to detect a connection loss and so would stall forever, the inlet_connection 
	* maintains a watchdog thread that periodically checks and recovers the connection state. Internally the recovery works by 
	* using the resolver to find the desired stream on the network again and updating the endpoint information if it has changed.
