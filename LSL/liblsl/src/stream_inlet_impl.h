		*					  (the default corresponds to the chunk sizes used by the sender).
		*					  Recording applications can use a generous size here (leaving it to the network how to pack things), 
		*					  while real-time applications may want a finer (perhaps 1-sample) granularity.
		* @param recover Try to silently recover lost streams that are recoverable (=those that that have a source_id set).
		*				 In all other cases (recover is false or the stream is not recoverable) a lost_error is thrown where
