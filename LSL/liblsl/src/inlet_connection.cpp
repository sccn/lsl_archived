* Construct a new inlet connection.
* @param info A resolved stream info object (as coming from one of the resolver functions).
*			  It is possible -- but highly discouraged -- to initialize a connection with an unresolved (i.e. made-up) stream_info; in this case, 
*			  a connection will be resolved alongside based on the provided info, but will only succeed if the channel count and channel format 
*		      match the one that is provided.
* @param recover Try to silently recover lost streams that are recoverable (=those that that have a source_id set).
*				 In all other cases (recover is false or the stream is not recoverable) a lost_error is thrown where indicated if the stream's source is lost (e.g., due to an app or computer crash).
