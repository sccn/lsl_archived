		/**
		* Active session with a TCP client.
		* A note on memory ownership:
		* - Generally, the stream_outlet maintains shared ownership of the tcp_server's, io_service's, and stream_info.
		* - At any point in time there are likely multiple request/handler chains in flight somewhere between the operating system,
		*   lslboost::asio, and the various handlers below. The handlers are set up such that any memory that may be referred to by them
		*	in the future is owned (shared) by the handler/callback function objects (this is what is encapsulated by the client_session
		*   instance). Their lifetime is managed by lslboost::asio and ends when the handler chain ends (e.g., is aborted). Since the TCP server
		*   is referred to (occasionally) by handler code, the tcp_server is owned also by the client_sessions, and therefore kept alive for as
		*   long as there is at least one request chain running.
		* - There is a per-session transfer thread (transfer_samples_thread) that owns the respective client_session and therefore the 
		*   TCP server, as well (since it may refer to it); it goes out of scope once the server is being shut down.
		* - The TCP server and client session also have shared ownership of the io_service (since in some cases some transfer threads
		*	can outlive the stream outlet, and so the io_service is still kept around until all sockets have been properly released).
		* - So memory is generally owned by the code (functors and stack frames) that needs to refer to it for the duration of the execution.
