Instructions for compiling and installing this php extension for Linux.

The wrapper files for this extension were created with swig simply by following the instructions in ../../AUTOGENERATE HOWTO.txt

You may want to consult this tutorial on building php extensions (provided the linke isn't stale):
http://www.sitepoint.com/install-php-extensions-source/
If the link is stale, there are many good tutorials on the web.

First, you will have to create a folder called 'libs' and copy the appropriate lsl binary for a linux build (i.e. liblsl64.so) into this folder.

Next, download the php source code into a local working directory. From the command line:

> wget http://be2.php.net/distributions/php-5.5.12.tar.bz2
> tar xvjf php-5.5.12.tar.bz2
> cd php-5.5.12

You will need php installed on your system, of course, as well as the php development tools:
Ubuntu:
> sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-mysql gcc libpcre3-dev

Fedora:
> sudo yum install php-devel php-mysqlnd gcc libtool

RHEL:
> sudo yum install php-devel php-mysql gcc libtool

Suse:
> yast2 -i php5-pear php5-devel php5-mysql gcc

Now, copy this directory into your <path to>/php-5.5.12/ext folder and cd into that directory
> cd <path to>/php-5.5.12/ext/liblsl-php

Now it is time to configure and build the extension.
> phpize
> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install

To enable the extension, you will have to copy the newly minted modules/liblsl.so into php's extension search path and create and ini file to handle it.
> cd /etc/php5/mods-available
> sudo touch liblsl.ini
> echo "extension=liblsl.so" | sudo tee -a liblsl.ini

Now enable the extension
> sudo php5enmod liblsl

You can test that everything is working by going back to the liblsl-php directory and running the example script 'tst_liblsl.php'. It should print out the current version of lsl.
