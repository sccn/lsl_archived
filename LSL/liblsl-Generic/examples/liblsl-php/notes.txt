These notes detail an unsuccesful attempt to compile this extension on windows. If anybody wants to try again, let us know if you make any progress.


downloaded php source and compile versions 5.6.14 from http://windows.php.net/download#php-5.6
combined the two directories 
added necessary environment variables

renamed file C:\php-src\zend\zend_config.w32.h to etc.\zend_config.h
copied etc.\win32\build\config.w32.h.in to etc.\main\config.w32.h

put preprocessor options:
ZEND_DEBUG=0
ZTS=1
ZEND_WIN32
PHP_WIN32
thanks to http://blog.slickedit.com/2007/09/creating-a-php-5-extension-with-visual-c-2005/ 

modified etc.\main\config.w32.h, commenting out last 4 lines:
//#ifndef _WIN64
//# define _USE_32BIT_TIME_T 1
//#endif
//#define HAVE_STDLIB_H 1

built project in visual studio, created a working extension, but could not load liblsl32.dll


loosely followed method shown here:
http://blog.benoitblanchon.fr/build-php-extension-on-windows/

had to drop the lsl-php project folder into the C:\php-6.14\ext folder in order for buildconf to recognize it and create the --enable-liblsl flag

got flex and bison binaries and added their paths to C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\common7\Tools\vsvars.bat on line 25 @ set PATH=<paths to programs>

at this point ran configure --disable-all --enable-cli --enable-liblsl, got fatal error code from bison

had to also instal libntl-0.1.4.4 (bison dependency), found this and another dependency in gnu-make (downloaded it and added to Path):
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/make-dep-zip.php

then, missing regex2.dll:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/regex.htm

getting closer -- now it builds a bunch of php stuff
hangs on stdint.h not found -- turns out its in VS 10, but not 9. I had both, so I moved the file from 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include, but you can also download it:
http://msinttypes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stdint.h

gobs of errors related to ext\standard\info.c -- looks as if VS 9.0 only works up to php5.4, reverting to this version

build works, but liblsl is not building -- the libraries (liblsl64.lib) are not found

tried the command line procedure outlined here:
http://blog.benoitblanchon.fr/build-php-extension-on-windows/
but was stuck on trying to find a configure.w32 equivalent to
PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WITH_PATH(lsl64, ./libs, LIBLSL_SHARED_LIBADD)
Stuck!

Compiled on linux and functioning, following this guide:
