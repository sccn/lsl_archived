/**
* C# API for the lab streaming layer.
* 
* The lab streaming layer provides a set of functions to make instrument data accessible 
* in real time within a lab network. From there, streams can be picked up by recording programs, 
* viewing programs or custom experiment applications that access data streams in real time.
*
* The API covers two areas:
* - The "push API" allows to create stream outlets and to push data (regular or irregular measurement 
*   time series, event data, coded audio/video frames, etc.) into them.
* - The "pull API" allows to create stream inlets and read time-synched experiment data from them 
*   (for recording, viewing or experiment control).
