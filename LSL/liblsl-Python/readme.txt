To use the pylsl module in a Python program, take the files pylsl.py alongside with the folders binaries-python* and put them in a package or path that is accessible to your program. If you like to distribute your program, we recommend that you bundle pylsl together with it.

If you like to rebuild pylsl for a particular Python version, you need to install that Python version and set up the environment variables PYTHON_INCLUDE to the value C:\your\path\to\python\include and PYTHON_LIB to the value C:\your\path\to\python\libs\python32.lib (or whatever lib version you have). You also need to install SWIG (http://www.swig.org/download.html) and add it to the path. Then open the .sln file with Visual Studio (you probably need 2008) and build it. This generates the files _liblsl.pyd and liblsl.py files in the same folder as the .sln file. Make a new folder named binaries-pythonX.Y and copy these two files there (together with a copy of the liblsl32.dll from LSL/liblsl/bin). Now pylsl.py should import correctly on your platform. For 64-bit Python you will need to put the liblsl64.dll in the binaries folder and upconvert the solution to x64.
