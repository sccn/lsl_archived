classdef lsl_inlet < handle
    % A stream inlet.
    % Inlets are used to receive streaming data (and meta-data) from the lab network.
    %
    % Note:
    %   Most functions of the inlet can throw an error of type 'lsl:lost_error' if the stream
    %   read by this inlet has been lost irretrievably. Those functions that take a timeout can in
    %   addition throw an error of type 'lsl:timeout_error'.

    properties (Hidden)

        InletHandle = 0;    % this is a handle to an lsl_inlet object within the library.        
        ChannelCount = 0;   % copy of the inlet's channel count

            %   Streaminfo : A resolved stream info object (as coming from one of the lsl_resolve_* functions).
            %
            %   MaxBuffered : Optionally the maximum amount of data to buffer (in seconds if there is a nominal
            %                  sampling rate, otherwise x100 in samples). Recording applications want to use a fairly
            %                  large buffer size here, while real-time applications would only buffer as much as
            %                  they need to perform their next calculation. (default: 360)
            %   
            %   ChunkSize : Optionally the maximum size, in samples, at which chunks are transmitted
            %                (0 corresponds to the chunk sizes used by the sender).
            %                Recording applications can use a generous size here (leaving it to the network how
            %                to pack things), while real-time applications may want a finer (perhaps 1-sample) granularity.
