== Usage ==

This program is currently untested since we don't have access to the hardware at this moment -- let me know if you find that it actually works. :-)

== Optional ==

The configuration settings can be saved to a .cfg file (see File / Save Configuration) and subsequently loaded from such a file (via File / Load Configuration). Importantly, the program can be started with a command-line argument of the form "iViewX.exe -c myconfig.cfg", which allows to load the config automatically at start-up. The recommended procedure to use the app in production experiments is to make a shortcut on the experimenter's desktop which points to a previously saved configuration customized to the study being recorded to minimize the chance of operator error.
