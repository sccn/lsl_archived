== Installation ==

Before you can use this program you must have installed the drivers for your g.HIamp. This program requires a 32-bit driver. 
Note that this program has not yet been tested. 

== Optional ==

The configuration settings can be saved to a .cfg file (see File / Save Configuration) and subsequently loaded from such a file (via File / Load Configuration). Importantly, the program can be started with a command-line argument of the form "gHIamp.exe -c myconfig.cfg", which allows to load the config automatically at start-up. The recommended procedure to use the app in production experiments is to make a shortcut on the experimenter's desktop which points to a previously saved configuration customized to the study being recorded to minimize the chance of operator error.
