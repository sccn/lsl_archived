#X text 20 311 This extern runs a continuous background thread. Its
structure is pretty simple \, but it is conceivable that there are
situations in which this thread can get left dangling and either leak
memory or hang Pd. Please report any bugs to the issues page on github:

#X text 20 413 Shipping with the source are a few extra doo-dads.;
#X text 20 537 For Windows \, pthreadVC2.dll is needed in order for
this code to run. I include it with the source. I compiled this as
a 32-bit binary in Windows \, so this is the 32-bit version of the
dll. If you want to compile and link a 64-bit version:;

and thanks to Miller Puckette for writing Pd!!!!;

#X text 682 129 <-list only the outlets of interest (this will change
the list and hence the meaning of the indices as well---also \, this
method hangs Pd);

#X text 20 76 Pure Data wrapper for an LSL inlet that can connect to
an active signal stream. Once connected \, [lsl_inlet~] will continuosuly
listen to the LSL stream. This gets packed into a Pd outlet \, but
the sampling period is left unchanged. That is to say \, if the lsl
inlet's rate is 1/10 of the SR in Pd \, every 10 samples will be identical.
If the sampling rate is higher than the audio rate \, all kinds of
unwanted artifacts will be present.;
#X obj 572 407 loadbang;
#X text 639 710 Unkowon bugs: Gazillions of 'em \, I'm sure.;
#X text 20 438 There are python scripts that send a random 'EEG' signal
(one for strings and one for floats). In order for these to run \,
your system will have to be correctly setup for python's LSL wrapper.
I.e. you need Python2.7 installed and your PYTHONPATH environment variable
will have to point to your copy of liblsl-Python. See LSL documentation
for more information on this.;
#X text 635 573 WARNING!!! This extern is still in the development
phase. It crashes sometimes for (currently) unknown reasons. Use at
your own risk!;

#X text 638 640 Known bugs: Sometimes \, it just crashes for like no
reason at all.;
#X text 679 329 <-as of now there are three creation arguments. -nout
is the number of outlets the extern should have. So far only 1 \, 2
\, 4 \, 8 \, 16 \, and 32 are supported. I have no idea why. -buflen
is the length (in dsp blocks) of the ring buffer that holds the samples
as they come in. 640 is probably overkill. -lag is the length (also
in blocks) to wait before outputing the incoming signal. If you put
'0' here \, the lag is 1 sample. Shown here are the default values.
