# === Storage Location ===
# the default file name can be something like C:\\Recordings\\untitled.xdf, but can also contain a 
# placeholder for a running number (incremented per experiment session) called %n, and a 
# placeholder for a "block" label %b (if the config script provides a list of block names that 
# consitute a session
# The syntax is as in: StorageLocation = "C:\\Recordings\\subject%n\\block_%b.xdf"

StorageLocation = "C:\\Recordings\\StudyXY\\subject%n\\block_%b.xdf"



# === Required Streams ===
# This is optionally a list of streams that are required for the recording; 
# a warning is issued if one of the streams is not present when the record button is pressed
# The syntax is as in: RequiredStreams = ["BioSemi","PhaseSpace","Eyelink"]

RequiredStreams = ["BioSemi","PhaseSpace","Eyelink","SNAP-Markers"]



# === Block Names ===
# This is optionally a list of blocks that make up a recording session. The blocks are displayed in 
# a list box where the experiment can select a block before pressing record. If used, the blocks 
# may serve as a reminder of where they are in the experiment, but more practically, can be 
# used to determine the file name of the recording. Power users can define scriptable actions 
# associated with selecting a block or pressing Start/Stop for a given block (e.g., for remote 
# control).
# The syntax is as in: SessionBlocks = ["Training","PreBaseline","MainBlock","PostBaseline"]

SessionBlocks = ["Training","PreBaseline","MainBlock","PostBaseline"]



# === Extra checks to apply to some of the streams ===
# Note that this is an optional advanced feature that is aimed at power users.
# For a subset of streams, a list of [condition,errormessage,condition,errormessage, ...] can be 
# given to inform the experimenter of possible problems with the recording setup (e.g., a device 
# was mis-configured); the syntax of the condition strings is XPath 1.0 (applied to the meta-data 
# of the stream) and the overall format for the ExtraCondtions variable is that of a Python 
# dictionary.

# Note: this checking functionality is currently not yet implemented in the recorder, so will be ignored.
ExtraChecks = {
     "BioSemi": ["type='EEG'","The stream type should be EEG.", 
                 "count(info/desc/channel)=32","The stream should have 32 channels."], 
     "Eyelink": ["nominal_srate=60","The sampling rate should be set to 60Hz."],
     "PhaseSpace": ["nominal_srate=30","The sampling rate should be set to 30Hz.", 
                    "info/desc/configuration=myconfig.xyz","The configuration myconfig.xyz should be used."]

# === Optional script actions ===
# Functions can be defined here that get called when the given action in the Experimenter GUI
# is triggered. For example, thi can be used to remote-control an experiment program on the 
# Subject's PC. If the function throws an exception, an warning message is presented to the 
# user to alert him of a possible problem. The user can choose to continue recording anyway.
# The script actions are implemented as Python functions; they may refer to the previously 
# declared config variables. These functions will only be triggered when EnableScriptedActions
# is set to True.
