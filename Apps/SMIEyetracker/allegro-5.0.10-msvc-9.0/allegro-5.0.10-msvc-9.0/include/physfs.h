 *
 * PhysicsFS; a portable, flexible file i/o abstraction.
 *
 * This API gives you access to a system file system in ways superior to the
 *  stdio or system i/o calls. The brief benefits:
 *
 *   - It's portable.
 *   - It's safe. No file access is permitted outside the specified dirs.
 *   - It's flexible. Archives (.ZIP files) can be used transparently as
 *      directory structures.
 *
 * This system is largely inspired by Quake 3's PK3 files and the related
 *  fs_* cvars. If you've ever tinkered with these, then this API will be
 *  familiar to you.
 *
 * With PhysicsFS, you have a single writing directory and multiple
 *  directories (the "search path") for reading. You can think of this as a
 *  filesystem within a filesystem. If (on Windows) you were to set the
 *  writing directory to "C:\MyGame\MyWritingDirectory", then no PHYSFS calls
 *  could touch anything above this directory, including the "C:\MyGame" and
 *  "C:\" directories. This prevents an application's internal scripting
 *  language from piddling over c:\\config.sys, for example. If you'd rather
 *  give PHYSFS full access to the system's REAL file system, set the writing
 *  dir to "C:\", but that's generally A Bad Thing for several reasons.
 *
 * Drive letters are hidden in PhysicsFS once you set up your initial paths.
 *  The search path creates a single, hierarchical directory structure.
 *  Not only does this lend itself well to general abstraction with archives,
 *  it also gives better support to operating systems like MacOS and Unix.
 *  Generally speaking, you shouldn't ever hardcode a drive letter; not only
 *  does this hurt portability to non-Microsoft OSes, but it limits your win32
 *  users to a single drive, too. Use the PhysicsFS abstraction functions and
 *  allow user-defined configuration options, too. When opening a file, you
 *  specify it like it was on a Unix filesystem: if you want to write to
 *  "C:\MyGame\MyConfigFiles\game.cfg", then you might set the write dir to
 *  "C:\MyGame" and then open "MyConfigFiles/game.cfg". This gives an
 *  abstraction across all platforms. Specifying a file in this way is termed
 *  "platform-independent notation" in this documentation. Specifying a
 *  a filename in a form such as "C:\mydir\myfile" or
 *  "MacOS hard drive:My Directory:My File" is termed "platform-dependent
 *  notation". The only time you use platform-dependent notation is when
 *  setting up your write directory and search path; after that, all file
 *  access into those directories are done with platform-independent notation.
 *
 * All files opened for writing are opened in relation to the write directory,
 *  which is the root of the writable filesystem. When opening a file for
 *  reading, PhysicsFS goes through the search path. This is NOT the
 *  same thing as the PATH environment variable. An application using
 *  PhysicsFS specifies directories to be searched which may be actual
 *  directories, or archive files that contain files and subdirectories of
 *  their own. See the end of these docs for currently supported archive
 *  formats.
 *
 * Once the search path is defined, you may open files for reading. If you've
 *  got the following search path defined (to use a win32 example again):
 *
 *  - C:\\mygame
 *  - C:\\mygame\\myuserfiles
 *  - D:\\mygamescdromdatafiles
 *  - C:\\mygame\\installeddatafiles.zip
 *
 * Then a call to PHYSFS_openRead("textfiles/myfile.txt") (note the directory
 *  separator, lack of drive letter, and lack of dir separator at the start of
 *  the string; this is platform-independent notation) will check for
 *  C:\\mygame\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then
 *  C:\\mygame\\myuserfiles\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then
 *  D:\\mygamescdromdatafiles\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then, finally, for
 *  textfiles\\myfile.txt inside of C:\\mygame\\installeddatafiles.zip.
 *  Remember that most archive types and platform filesystems store their
 *  filenames in a case-sensitive manner, so you should be careful to specify
 *  it correctly.
 *
 * Files opened through PhysicsFS may NOT contain "." or ".." or ":" as dir
 *  elements. Not only are these meaningless on MacOS Classic and/or Unix,
 *  they are a security hole. Also, symbolic links (which can be found in
 *  some archive types and directly in the filesystem on Unix platforms) are
 *  NOT followed until you call PHYSFS_permitSymbolicLinks(). That's left to
 *  your own discretion, as following a symlink can allow for access outside
 *  the write dir and search paths. For portability, there is no mechanism for
 *  creating new symlinks in PhysicsFS.
 *
 * The write dir is not included in the search path unless you specifically
 *  add it. While you CAN change the write dir as many times as you like,
 *  you should probably set it once and stick to it. Remember that your
 *  program will not have permission to write in every directory on Unix and
 *  NT systems.
 *
 * All files are opened in binary mode; there is no endline conversion for
 *  textfiles. Other than that, PhysicsFS has some convenience functions for
 *  platform-independence. There is a function to tell you the current
 *  platform's dir separator ("\\" on windows, "/" on Unix, ":" on MacOS),
 *  which is needed only to set up your search/write paths. There is a
 *  function to tell you what CD-ROM drives contain accessible discs, and a
 *  function to recommend a good search path, etc.
 *
 * A recommended order for the search path is the write dir, then the base dir,
 *  then the cdrom dir, then any archives discovered. Quake 3 does something
 *  like this, but moves the archives to the start of the search path. Build
 *  Engine games, like Duke Nukem 3D and Blood, place the archives last, and
 *  use the base dir for both searching and writing. There is a helper
 *  function (PHYSFS_setSaneConfig()) that puts together a basic configuration
 *  for you, based on a few parameters. Also see the comments on
 *  PHYSFS_getBaseDir(), and PHYSFS_getUserDir() for info on what those
 *  are and how they can help you determine an optimal search path.
 *
 * PhysicsFS 2.0 adds the concept of "mounting" archives to arbitrary points
 *  in the search path. If a zipfile contains "maps/level.map" and you mount
 *  that archive at "mods/mymod", then you would have to open
 *  "mods/mymod/maps/level.map" to access the file, even though "mods/mymod"
 *  isn't actually specified in the .zip file. Unlike the Unix mentality of
 *  mounting a filesystem, "mods/mymod" doesn't actually have to exist when
 *  mounting the zipfile. It's a "virtual" directory. The mounting mechanism
 *  allows the developer to seperate archives in the tree and avoid trampling
 *  over files when added new archives, such as including mod support in a
 *  game...keeping external content on a tight leash in this manner can be of
 *  utmost importance to some applications.
 *
 * PhysicsFS is mostly thread safe. The error messages returned by
 *  PHYSFS_getLastError are unique by thread, and library-state-setting
 *  functions are mutex'd. For efficiency, individual file accesses are 
 *  not locked, so you can not safely read/write/seek/close/etc the same 
 *  file from two threads at the same time. Other race conditions are bugs 
 *  that should be reported/patched.
 *
 * While you CAN use stdio/syscall file access in a program that has PHYSFS_*
 *  calls, doing so is not recommended, and you can not use system
 *  filehandles with PhysicsFS and vice versa.
 *
 * Note that archives need not be named as such: if you have a ZIP file and
 *  rename it with a .PKG extension, the file will still be recognized as a
 *  ZIP archive by PhysicsFS; the file's contents are used to determine its
 *  type where possible.
 *
 * Currently supported archive types:
 *   - .ZIP (pkZip/WinZip/Info-ZIP compatible)
 *   - .GRP (Build Engine groupfile archives)
 *   - .PAK (Quake I/II archive format)
 *   - .HOG (Descent I/II HOG file archives)
 *   - .MVL (Descent II movielib archives)
 *   - .WAD (DOOM engine archives)
 *
 *
 * String policy for PhysicsFS 2.0 and later:
 *
 * PhysicsFS 1.0 could only deal with null-terminated ASCII strings. All high
 *  ASCII chars resulted in undefined behaviour, and there was no Unicode
 *  support at all. PhysicsFS 2.0 supports Unicode without breaking binary
 *  compatibility with the 1.0 API by using UTF-8 encoding of all strings
 *  passed in and out of the library.
 *
 * All strings passed through PhysicsFS are in null-terminated UTF-8 format.
 *  This means that if all you care about is English (ASCII characters <= 127)
 *  then you just use regular C strings. If you care about Unicode (and you
 *  should!) then you need to figure out what your platform wants, needs, and
 *  offers. If you are on Windows and build with Unicode support, your TCHAR
 *  strings are two bytes per character (this is called "UCS-2 encoding"). You
 *  should convert them to UTF-8 before handing them to PhysicsFS with
 *  PHYSFS_utf8FromUcs2(). If you're using Unix or Mac OS X, your wchar_t
 *  strings are four bytes per character ("UCS-4 encoding"). Use
 *  PHYSFS_utf8FromUcs4(). Mac OS X can give you UTF-8 directly from a
 *  CFString, and many Unixes generally give you C strings in UTF-8 format
 *  everywhere. If you have a single-byte high ASCII charset, like so-many
 *  European "codepages" you may be out of luck. We'll convert from "Latin1"
 *  to UTF-8 only, and never back to Latin1. If you're above ASCII 127, all
 *  bets are off: move to Unicode or use your platform's facilities. Passing a
 *  C string with high-ASCII data that isn't UTF-8 encoded will NOT do what
 *  you expect!
 *
 * Naturally, there's also PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs2() and PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs4() to get
 *  data back into a format you like. Behind the scenes, PhysicsFS will use
 *  Unicode where possible: the UTF-8 strings on Windows will be converted
 *  and used with the multibyte Windows APIs, for example.
 *
 * PhysicsFS offers basic encoding conversion support, but not a whole string
 *  library. Get your stuff into whatever format you can work with.
 *
 * Some platforms and archivers don't offer full Unicode support behind the
 *  scenes. For example, OS/2 only offers "codepages" and the filesystem
 *  itself doesn't support multibyte encodings. We make an earnest effort to
 *  convert to/from the current locale here, but all bets are off if
 *  you want to hand an arbitrary Japanese character through to these systems.
 *  Modern OSes (Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, PocketPC, etc) should all be fine.
 *  Many game-specific archivers are seriously unprepared for Unicode (the
 *  Descent HOG/MVL and Build Engine GRP archivers, for example, only offer a
 *  DOS 8.3 filename, for example). Nothing can be done for these, but they
 *  tend to be legacy formats for existing content that was all ASCII (and
 *  thus, valid UTF-8) anyhow. Other formats, like .ZIP, don't explicitly
 *  offer Unicode support, but unofficially expect filenames to be UTF-8
 *  encoded, and thus Just Work. Most everything does the right thing without
 *  bothering you, but it's good to be aware of these nuances in case they
 *  don't.

 * \fn int PHYSFS_setBuffer(PHYSFS_File *handle, PHYSFS_uint64 bufsize)
 * \brief Set up buffering for a PhysicsFS file handle.
 *
 * Define an i/o buffer for a file handle. A memory block of (bufsize) bytes
 *  will be allocated and associated with (handle).
 *
 * For files opened for reading, up to (bufsize) bytes are read from (handle)
 *  and stored in the internal buffer. Calls to PHYSFS_read() will pull
 *  from this buffer until it is empty, and then refill it for more reading.
 *  Note that compressed files, like ZIP archives, will decompress while
 *  buffering, so this can be handy for offsetting CPU-intensive operations.
 *  The buffer isn't filled until you do your next read.
 *
 * For files opened for writing, data will be buffered to memory until the
 *  buffer is full or the buffer is flushed. Closing a handle implicitly
 *  causes a flush...check your return values!
 *
 * Seeking, etc transparently accounts for buffering.
 *
 * You can resize an existing buffer by calling this function more than once
 *  on the same file. Setting the buffer size to zero will free an existing
 *  buffer.
 *
 * PhysicsFS file handles are unbuffered by default.
 *
 * Please check the return value of this function! Failures can include
 *  not being able to seek backwards in a read-only file when removing the
 *  buffer, not being able to allocate the buffer, and not being able to
 *  flush the buffer to disk, among other unexpected problems.
 *
 *   \param handle handle returned from PHYSFS_open*().
 *   \param bufsize size, in bytes, of buffer to allocate.
 *  \return nonzero if successful, zero on error.
