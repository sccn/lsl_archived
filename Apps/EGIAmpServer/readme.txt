# Usage

Note: This program is currently untested since we don't have physical access to a NetAmp. If you experience issues while trying to use it, please let us know so we can take a look at the problem and debug it if necessary.

# Optional

The configuration settings can be saved to a .cfg file (see File / Save Configuration) and
subsequently loaded from such a file (via File / Load Configuration).

Importantly, the program can be started with a command-line argument of the form
`EGIAmpServer.exe myconfig.cfg`, which allows to load the config automatically at start-up.
The recommended procedure to use the app in production experiments is to make a shortcut on
the experimenter's desktop which points to a previously saved configuration customized to the
study being recorded to minimize the chance of operator error.
