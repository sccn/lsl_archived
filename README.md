# Summary

The **lab streaming layer** (LSL) is a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, (near-) real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data.

The **LSL distribution** consists of:
  * The core transport library (liblsl) and its language interfaces (C, C++, Python, Java, C#, MATLAB). The library is general-purpose and cross-platform (Win/Linux/MacOS, 32/64) and forms the heart of the project.
  * A suite of tools built on top of the library, including a [recording program](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/LabRecorder.wiki), [online viewers](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/ViewingStreamsInMatlab.wiki), [importers](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/ImportingRecordingsInMatlab.wiki), and apps that make data from a range of [acquisition hardware](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/SupportedDevices.wiki) available on the lab network (for example audio, EEG, or motion capture).

There is an intro lecture/demo on LSL here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1at7yrcFW0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1at7yrcFW0) (part of an online course on EEG-based brain-computer interfaces).

Hosted here is only the source code for the project. Develpers will want to clone this repo, then run 'python get_deps.py' to download all the 3rd party libraries from our ftp.

# Streaming Layer API

The liblsl library provides the following **abstractions** for use by client programs:

  * **Stream Outlets**: for making time series data streams available on the lab network. The data is pushed sample-by-sample or chunk-by-chunk into the outlet, and can consist of single- or multichannel data, regular or irregular sampling rate, with uniform value types (integers, floats, doubles, strings). Streams can have arbitrary XML meta-data (akin to a file header). By creating an outlet the stream is made visible to a collection of computers (defined by the network settings/layout) where one can subscribe to it by creating an inlet.

  * **Resolve functions**: these allow to resolve streams that are present on the lab network according to content-based queries (for example, by name, content-type, or queries on the meta-data). The service discovery features do not depend on external services such as zeroconf and are meant to drastically simplify the data collection network setup.

  * **Stream Inlets**: for receiving time series data from a connected outlet. Allows to retrieve samples from the provider (in-order, with reliable transmission, optional type conversion and optional failure recovery). Besides the samples, the meta-data can be obtained (as XML blob or alternatively through a small built-in DOM interface).

  * **Built-in clock**: Allows to time-stamp the transmitted samples so that they can be mutually synchronized. See Time Synchronization.

# Reliability
The following reliability features are implemented by the library (transparently):
  * Transport inherits the reliability of TCP, is message-oriented (partitioned into samples) and type safe.

  * The library provides automatic failure recovery from application or computer crashes to minimize data loss (optional); this makes it possible to replace a computer in the middle of a recording without having to restart the data collection.

  * Data is buffered both at the sender and receiver side (with configurable and arbitrarily large buffers) to tolerate intermittent network failures.

  * Transmission is type safe, and supports type conversions as necessary.

# Time Synchronization
The lab streaming layer comes with a built-in synchronized time facility for all recorded data which is designed to achieve sub-millisecond accuracy on a local network of computers. This facility serves to provide out-of-the-box support for synchronized data collection but does not preclude the use of user-supplied alternative timestamps, for example from commercial timing middleware or high-quality clocks.

The built-in time synchronization is designed after the widely deployed Network Time Protocol (NTP) and implemented in the LSL library. This feature is explained in more detail in the [TimeSynchronization](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/TimeSynchronization.wiki) section.
# File Format
The transport API itself does not endorse or provide a particular file format, but the provided recording program (`LabRecorder`) and Python/C++ library (`RecorderLib`) record into the XDF file format (Extensible Data Format, hosted at https://github.com/sccn/xdf). XDF was designed concurrently with the lab streaming layer and supports the full feature set of LSL (including multi-stream container files, per-stream arbitrarily large XML headers, all sample formats as well as time-synchronization information).

# Coding Guides
The distribution includes a range of code examples in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, and C# including some very simple sender and receiver programs, as well as some fairly extensive demo apps. This page includes just some simple teasers. See [ExampleCode](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/ExampleCode.wiki) for a broader overview of example programs, API documentation link, and general programming tips, tricks, and frequently asked questions.

## Sending Random Data in C++
```
#include "lsl_cpp.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
using namespace lsl;

/**
 * This is an example of how a simple data stream can be offered on the network. 
 * Here, the stream is named SimpleStream, has content-type EEG, and 128 channels.
 * The transmitted samples contain random numbers (and the sampling rate is irregular 
 * and effectively bounded by the speed at which the program can push out samples).
 */

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

	// make a new stream_info (128ch) and open an outlet with it
	stream_info info("SimpleStream","EEG",128);
	stream_outlet outlet(info);

	// send data forever
	float sample[128];
	while(true) {
		// generate random data
		for (int c=0;c<128;c++)
			sample[c] = (rand()%1500)/500.0-1.5;
		// send it
		outlet.push_sample(sample);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

## Receiving Data in C++
```
#include "lsl_cpp.h"

/**
 * This is a minimal example that demonstrates how a multi-channel stream (here 128ch) 
 * of a particular name (here: SimpleStream) can be resolved into an inlet, and how the 
 * raw sample data & time stamps are pulled from the inlet. This example does not 
 * display the obtained data.
 */

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	using namespace lsl;

	// resolve the stream of interest & make an inlet to get data from the first result
	std::vector<stream_info> results = resolve_stream("name","SimpleStream");
	stream_inlet inlet(results[0]);

	// receive data & time stamps forever (not displaying them here)
	float sample[128];
	while (true)
		double ts = inlet.pull_sample(&sample[0],128);
	
	return 0;
}
```
